// TO DO!

DESCRIPTION 
In this project, you will build a “microblogging” website that allows users to share brief
insights about their craft, hobby, or profession.
User, post, and login data for this project will be stored on a back-end server designed
for this project, called MicroblogLite.
Your app will provide visitors with the option to create a user account and new posts, and
you may choose to add a feature for users to “like” posts, but this is as complicated as it
will get. (The MicroblogLite API does not provide functionality for users to “follow” each
other or to comment on posts.)
Your app will be a “walled garden.” That is, in order to view any user content, a visitor to
the website must first log in as a user.
You will use what you know about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this project.
You will also need to flex your research skills to solve any blockers you run into.
But don’t worry: some code and guidance will be provided to get you started! Be sure to
read this entire document and the source code in the starter project! They include lots of
things which will save you a lot of time and effort!
